  <h1>Hello, I am John Ryan Villaluz!</h1>
  <img src="images/absolutecinema.png" alt="It is a picture of John Villaluz holding up his hands making the absolute cinema meme">
  <p>I am currently a Third-year student at Illinois Tech. I am majoring in a Bachelor of Information Technology and Management with the hopes of working in the defense industry as a System Administrator.
  <p>I am very passionate in a lot of things: do you want to talk about Military Aircraft? Anime? Grand Strategy Games? I can talk about a variety of topics.</p>
  <p>I would also consider myself to be a professional yapper. I'm pretty open-minded (no matter how clueless I maybe) to any topic that people are willing to discuss. The best way for us to grow and become the very best we can as human beings is to strive to learn from various avenues of life, even if you aren't really comfortable with those topics.</p>
